Art-Thou-A-Witch



Art Thou A Wicth is a 2D browser game created as a learning exercise of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

Composed of three screens, a player can naviagte from the start page into the game itself by clicking the "start" button.

Once in the game "arena", the keyboard arrows right and left will move the player's character in those directions. The goal is to fit in through the gaps of the lines of advancing obstacles without letting the witch touch the spanish inquisition agents. As the time passes que rows of obstacles become more frequent, increasing difficulty in navigation.

Upon collision the game is lost and the player is redirected to the game over screen, where the end of the storyline can be seen and the option to restart is presented.

For this game HTML is used to structure the overall content of the game, while CSS handles the styling aspects. JavaScript is then applied to manipulate the DOM structure, allowing for the interactiveness required of a browser game.


Given the educational nature of this project, a strict timeframe was imposed on it's development. This led to a challenging  decision-making process of what features to implement to make the game more apealing and the time to employ methodologies that are so new to me, as a student.
The management of the obstacle class behaviour and subsequent lose-logic based on it's interaction with the player was undoubtedly the main challenge I faced. But going through so many different approaches until achieving the designed outcome has been the biggest learning curve in the entire project.

Through all the pressure and stress, somehow I had a great time developing this small game and am now filled with ideas and plans to improve it in the long run, as well as build different projects. 

For Art Thou a Witch, I hope to improve on the overall styling, making the characters and background more dynamic. Another feature I would love to implement would be to expand on the obstacle-player relation and have different requirements reveal themselves on a lever-up based logic. Things as projectile motion and a task-completion logic.
